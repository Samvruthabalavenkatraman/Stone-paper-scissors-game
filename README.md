# Stone-paper-scissors-game

What is rock, paper and scissors?
Rock, paper, scissors is a game played by using hands which can also be used as a toss when a decision on something between two or more people cannot be made. 

To play this game, participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then put their hands forward forming the shape of either of the three.

Making a fist represents rock, an open hand with palm facing down represents paper and two fingers (index and middle finger) extended represents scissors. 

In this article, we will walk through how to make a rock paper scissor game in Python.

 Defineing the rules of the game
In order to create a rock paper scissor game, we should be fully familiar with the rules of the game. The rules state that rock smashes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. So, rock wins over scissors, scissors win over paper and paper wins over rock. With the understanding of the rules, we can proceed to create the game.

 Running the code
To write and run python code, we need a compiler. Online compilers are also available to write and run a code. Just search “python compiler” and you will have many results. Here is an example of a compiler running the code we have written above. You should see a prompt asking you to input your choice. Once you’ve made your choice, the program will print out the computer’s choice and the winner of the game.

Thank you!!
