What is rock, paper and scissors?


💫Rock, paper, scissors is a game played by using hands which can also be used as a toss when a decision on something between two or more people cannot be made. 

💫To play this game, participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then put their hands forward forming the shape of either of the three.

💫Making a fist represents rock, an open hand with palm facing down represents paper and two fingers (index and middle finger) extended represents scissors. 

💫In this article, we will walk through how to make a rock paper scissor game in Python.

 💫In order to create a rock paper scissor game, we should be fully familiar with the rules of the game. 

💫The rules state that rock smashes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. 

💫Rock wins over scissors, scissors win over paper and paper wins over rock. With the understanding of the rules, we can proceed to create the game.
